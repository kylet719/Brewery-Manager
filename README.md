# Brewery Manager
## Project Description
The domain of the application will cover breweries which includes beer crafting, production processes, customer feedback, and inventory management. 

As our domain covers multiple breweries, it could act as a guide for consumers to locate breweries with highly rated craft beer, along with how the drink is made. Conversely, this could be used by a regulatory body keeping records of breweries. The application also delves into inventory management, keeping track of equipment like fermenters and brew kettles. Lastly, it facilitates an understanding of customer feedback and preferences, aiding in targeted marketing and product development efforts.
